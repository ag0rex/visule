x       apply systems on world state

x       add system init function
x       system dependencies -> system state (stored in world state)
x           e.g. put render frame in system state
x           note: system state should not change  

x       move systems to separate namespaces

x       new size system

x       new move system

x       new render system

        return values for system functions
               diff / new state
