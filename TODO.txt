x       apply systems on world state

x       add system init function
x       system dependencies -> system state (stored in world state)
x         e.g. put render frame in system state
x         note: system state should not change  

x       move systems to separate namespaces

x       new size system

x       new move system

x       new render system

x       collision to be part of the move component

        split regen system
          system for removal
          system for generation

        return values for system functions
          diff / new state

        add protocol for systems

        add records for components

        event-based generation of entities
          mutable source of events

        macro to add systems
          would allow injection of system key

        time-based generation of entities
x         interval system
          timeout system
